### App Description

```react
When you clone the project and run it locally, it may not work as expected because you don't have the .env file. You can inspect the project's code by cloning it, and you can experience the project in live mode in a production environment.

Before entering the project, please complete the authentication process (It is recommended to log in with your Google or GitHub account).

CRUD operations are available in the API. Create, Update, and Patch operations in the API, while GET requests in the Page components with SSR are directly done through Prisma. GET requests in the API are written for the purpose of creating API documentation.

You can explore the existing activities in the project, update them, delete them, and create new activities. You can filter activities on the homepage based on specific criteria and search for them using the search feature.

On the detail page, you can access much more information about the activity.
```
